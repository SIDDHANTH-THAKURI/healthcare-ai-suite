## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: All Services at Once
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Individual Services
```bash
npm run dev:web      # Frontend - http://localhost:5173
npm run dev:api      # API Gateway - http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:ml       # ML Service - http://localhost:8000
npm run dev:ddi      # DDI Service - http://localhost:9000
```

### Option 3: Windows PowerShell Script
```powershell
./scripts/dev.ps1
```

## 📦 Service Breakdown

### 🌐 Web App (`apps/web/`)
- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Port**: 5173
- **Purpose**: User interface for doctors and patients

### 🔗 API Gateway (`apps/api-gateway/`)
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Port**: 3000
- **Purpose**: Authentication, user management, data orchestration

### 🧠 ML Service (`apps/ml-service/`)
- **Technology**: Python + FastAPI
- **Port**: 8000
- **Purpose**: Patient history processing, chatbot, LLM integration

### 💊 DDI Service (`apps/ddi-service/`)
- **Technology**: Python + FastAPI
- **Port**: 9000
- **Purpose**: Drug interaction detection, ChemBERTa models, deidentification

## 🔧 Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a specific responsibility
2. **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously
3. **Scalable Deployment**: Services can be deployed and scaled independently
4. **Better Organization**: Code is logically grouped and easier to navigate
5. **Shared Resources**: Common types and utilities are centralized
6. **Professional Structure**: Follows industry best practices for microservices

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm run install:all`
2. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
3. **Build for Production**: `npm run build`
4. **Lint Code**: `npm run lint`

## 📝 Important Notes

- All original functionality is preserved
- API endpoints remain the same
- Environment variables work as before
- Database connections are unchanged
- ML models are in `docs/ml-models/` (formerly `EXTRAS/`)

## 🔄 Migration Checklist

- ✅ Frontend moved to `apps/web/`
- ✅ Node.js backend moved to `apps/api-gateway/`
- ✅ Python ML service moved to `apps/ml-service/`
- ✅ Python DDI service moved to `apps/ddi-service/`
- ✅ Shared types created in `packages/types/`
- ✅ Build scripts moved to `scripts/`
- ✅ Configuration files organized in `config/`
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Package.json files updated
- ✅ Development scripts created
- ✅ Deployment configuration updated

## 🎉 Ready to Go!
