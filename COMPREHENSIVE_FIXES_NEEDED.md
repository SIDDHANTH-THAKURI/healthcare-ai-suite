## Logical Medication Tracking System:

### How it should work:
1. User adds medication with start date and schedule times
2. System creates daily entries for each day
3. Each day shows only that day's medications
4. User marks medications as taken throughout the day
5. Stats update in real-time:
   - **Meds Today**: Count of active medications for today
   - **Taken**: Count of medications taken today
   - **Adherence**: Percentage of medications taken on time

### Time Slots:
- Morning: 6:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Afternoon: 12:00 PM - 5:00 PM
- Evening: 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM
- Night: 9:00 PM - 6:00 AM

This is more intuitive than exact times for patients.
