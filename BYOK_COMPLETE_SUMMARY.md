## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow

```
New User Signs Up
       ↓
Gets 20 free messages/day
       ↓
Uses AI chat (counter decreases: 19, 18, 17...)
       ↓
Hits limit (0 remaining)
       ↓
Upgrade Modal appears
       ↓
User clicks "Add API Key"
       ↓
Settings page opens with instructions
       ↓
User adds OpenRouter API key
       ↓
Unlimited messages forever! 🎉
```

### Technical Flow

```
User sends message
       ↓
Frontend calls /api/chat/message with userId
       ↓
Backend checks: Does user have API key?
       ├─ YES → Use their key, unlimited
       └─ NO  → Check daily count
              ├─ < 20 → Allow, increment counter
              └─ ≥ 20 → Return 429 error
       ↓
Frontend receives response
       ├─ 200 → Show message, update counter
       └─ 429 → Show upgrade modal
```
