# Medication Tracking System Update

## Overview
Updated the medication management system with improved frequency selection, time-of-day tracking, and real-time medication adherence monitoring.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Prescription Creation (CreatePrescription.tsx)

#### New Frequency System
- **Replaced**: Single "Frequency" text input
- **Added**: Two-dropdown system:
  1. **Frequency Type Dropdown**: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, or Custom
  2. **Custom Frequency Input**: Appears when "Custom" is selected
  3. **Times of Day Multi-Select**: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night checkboxes

#### Updated Medicine Interface
```typescript
interface Medicine {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  dosage: string;
  frequencyType?: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly' | 'custom';
  customFrequency?: string;
  timesOfDay?: string[];
  duration?: string;
  status?: 'active' | 'inactive';
  startDate?: string;
  endDate?: string;
}
```

#### Fixed Edit Functionality
- Properly initializes `timesOfDay`, `frequencyType`, and `customFrequency` when editing
- Handles checkbox state correctly for multi-select times of day
- Updates display to show new format: "Dosage • Frequency • Times • Duration"

### 2. Medications Page (MedicationsPage.tsx)

#### Updated Add Medication Form
- Replaced "Times Per Day" dropdown with "Frequency Type" dropdown
- Added "Custom Frequency" input field (conditional)
- Added "Times of Day" multi-select checkboxes
- Removed manual time input fields

#### Smart Schedule Generation
- Automatically maps times of day to default times:
  - Morning: 08:00
  - Afternoon: 14:00
  - Evening: 18:00
  - Night: 22:00
- Stores both `time` and `timeOfDay` in schedule objects

#### Updated Medication Interface
```typescript
interface Medication {
  _id: string;
  patientId: string;
  medicationName: string;
  dosage: string;
  frequencyType?: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly' | 'custom';
  customFrequency?: string;
  timesOfDay?: string[];
  medicationImage?: string;
  // ... other fields
  schedules: Array<{
    time: string;
    timeOfDay?: string;
    taken: boolean;
    takenAt?: Date;
    skipped: boolean;
    skipReason?: string;
  }>;
}
```

### 3. Patient Portal (PatientPortal.tsx)

#### Enhanced "Meds Today" Section
- **Total Count**: Shows number of unique medications scheduled for today
- **Taken Count**: Shows number of medication doses taken today
- **Adherence Score**: Calculates percentage based on taken vs. total

#### Improved "Today's Medications" Display
- Groups medications by time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
- Shows medication image if available, otherwise shows icon
- Displays medication name and dosage
- **Auto-hide**: Time slots disappear once all medications are marked as taken
- **Check Button**: Single checkmark button to mark as taken
- **Real-time Updates**: Taken count increases immediately when checked

#### Smart Grouping Logic
```typescript
const groupMedicationsByTime = () => {
  // Groups by timeOfDay field (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
  // Sorts in chronological order
  // Filters out taken medications from display
}
```

### 4. Styling Updates

#### CreatePrescription.css
- Added `.times-of-day-selector` grid layout (2 columns)
- Added `.checkbox-label` styling with hover effects
- Checkbox accent color matches primary theme
- Dark mode support

#### MedicationsPage.css
- Same checkbox styling as CreatePrescription
- Consistent visual design across components

#### PatientPortal.css
- Added `.pill-image` styling for medication images
- 48x48px rounded images with border
- Dark mode border support

## User Flow

### Adding a Prescription
1. Doctor selects or types medication name
2. Enters dosage (e.g., "500mg")
3. Selects frequency type (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly/Custom)
4. If custom, enters custom frequency text
5. Checks one or more times of day (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night)
6. Enters duration (e.g., "7 days")
7. Saves prescription

### Patient View
1. Patient sees "Meds Today" count on dashboard
2. Medications grouped by time of day in "Today's Medications"
3. Each medication shows image (if uploaded) and name
4. Patient clicks checkmark to mark as taken
5. Medication disappears from that time slot
6. "Taken" count increases
7. Adherence score updates

## Validation

### Prescription Creation
- Medicine name must be from available medicines list
- Dosage is required
- At least one time of day must be selected
- Duration is required
- Custom frequency required if "Custom" type selected

### Medication Addition
- Medication name, dosage, and start date required
- At least one time of day must be selected
- Validates before allowing save

## Backend Compatibility

The system sends the following structure to the backend:
```json
{
  "medicationName": "Aspirin",
  "dosage": "500mg",
  "frequencyType": "daily",
  "customFrequency": "",
  "timesOfDay": ["Morning", "Evening"],
  "schedules": [
    {
      "time": "08:00",
      "timeOfDay": "Morning",
      "taken": false,
      "skipped": false
    },
    {
      "time": "18:00",
      "timeOfDay": "Evening",
      "taken": false,
      "skipped": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Dropdowns and checkboxes are easier than text input
2. **Consistency**: Standardized time-of-day labels
3. **Flexibility**: Custom frequency option for special cases
4. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time updates when medications are taken
5. **Motivation**: Adherence score encourages compliance
6. **Clean Interface**: Completed medications auto-hide
7. **Image Support**: Visual identification of medications
