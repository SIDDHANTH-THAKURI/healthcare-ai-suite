# Drug Interaction Checker - Usage Limit Implementation

## Overview
Added a beautiful 10-check daily limit system for the home page drug interaction checker to manage LLM API usage effectively.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Usage Tracking**
- Tracks the number of drug interaction checks performed
- Stores count in `localStorage` for persistence across sessions
- Limit: **10 checks per session**

### 2. **Visual Usage Indicator**
- **Progress Bar**: Beautiful gradient bar showing remaining checks
  - Green to orange gradient (2a9d8f â†’ E76F51)
  - Turns red when approaching limit
  - Smooth animations and transitions
- **Counter Text**: "X checks remaining" with lightning bolt icon âš¡
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile and desktop layouts

### 3. **Limit Reached Modal**
- **Elegant Design**: 
  - Lock icon ðŸ”’ with shake animation
  - Clear messaging about the limit
  - Professional gradient background
- **Benefits Section**: 
  - Lists premium features available with account
  - Checkmark bullets for easy scanning
- **Call-to-Action**:
  - "Sign Up for Free" button (links to /authentication)
  - "Close" button to dismiss modal
- **User-Friendly Message**: 
  - Explains why limit exists (LLM usage)
  - Notes that limit resets in 24 hours
  - Encourages account creation for more features

### 4. **Button State Management**
- Button text changes to "Limit Reached" when exhausted
- Button becomes disabled (grayed out) at limit
- Smooth hover effects disabled when limit reached

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const MAX_CHECKS = 10;
const [checksUsed, setChecksUsed] = useState<number>(0);
const [showLimitModal, setShowLimitModal] = useState(false);
```

### Usage Tracking
- Loads count from `localStorage` on component mount
- Increments count after each successful interaction check
- Persists to `localStorage` after each check

### UI Components
1. **Checker Header**: Split layout with title and usage indicator
2. **Usage Bar**: Animated progress bar with dynamic width
3. **Limit Modal**: Full-screen overlay with centered modal

## Styling Highlights

### Color Scheme
- Primary: `#2a9d8f` (teal)
- Accent: `#E76F51` (coral)
- Warning: Gradient from teal to coral
- Background: White with subtle gradients

### Animations
- `slideUp`: Modal entrance animation
- `shake`: Lock icon animation
- Smooth transitions on all interactive elements

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Side-by-side header layout
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout with full-width usage bar
- **Mobile**: Optimized spacing and font sizes

## User Experience Flow

1. **First Visit**: User sees "10 checks remaining"
2. **After Each Check**: Counter decrements, progress bar fills
3. **Approaching Limit**: Bar turns red (at 80%+)
4. **Limit Reached**: 
   - Button disabled
   - Modal appears on next attempt
   - Clear upgrade path shown
