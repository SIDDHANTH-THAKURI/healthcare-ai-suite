## üîß Still To Implement

### 1. Edit Medication
**Status:** Button exists but not functional

- Filter medications by today's date
- Show only schedules for today
- Implement daily medication entries system

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (requires backend changes)

---

### 3. AI Chatbot Debug
**Status:** Unknown - needs testing
**Steps:**
1. Test if backend is running
2. Check OpenRouter API key
3. Test chat endpoint
4. Check frontend console for errors
5. Add error handling

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes - 1 hour

## How to Test

### Test Appointments:

2. Start frontend: `cd apps/web && npm start`
3. Go to Patient Portal
4. Click "Appointments" card
5. Click "New Appointment"

4. Check "Taken" - should increase
5. Check adherence score - should update

### Test Next Medication:
1. Add medications with different times

## Backend Endpoints Summary

### Appointments:
- `GET /api/appointments/:patientId` - Get all appointments
- `POST /api/appointments` - Create appointment
- `PATCH /api/appointments/:id` - Update appointment
- `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Delete appointment

### Medications:
- `GET /api/medication-schedule/:patientId` - Get all medications
- `GET /api/medication-schedule/today/:patientId` - Get today's medications
- `POST /api/medication-schedule` - Create medication
- `PATCH /api/medication-schedule/:id/take` - Mark as taken
- `PATCH /api/medication-schedule/:id/skip` - Skip medication
- `DELETE /api/medication-schedule/:id` - Delete medication
- **NEEDED:** `PUT /api/medication-schedule/:id` - Update medication

## Known Issues

### 1. Today's Medications
The current system shows ALL medications, not just today's. This needs a redesign:

**Current:** One document per medication
**Better:** Daily entries for each medication

This requires significant backend changes and is the biggest remaining issue.

### 2. Edit Medication
Button exists but doesn't work. Needs:
- State management for editing
- Form population
- Backend PUT endpoint
- Save logic

### 3. Chat System
Needs testing and debugging. May work fine, may need fixes.
